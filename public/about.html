<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Berkay, my surname is Furan. I was born on April 2, 2003 in Izmir, Turkey.</p>

<p>My dream was to be a football player, and I started playing at the age of 5 and continued until I was 21. I played in the youth teams of football clubs at the Turkish Super League level, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't become a professional football player. I am also a graduate of a sports high school and I am continuing to study physical education remotely. When my football career ended, I decided that this wouldn't be enough and I decided to study computer engineering.</p>

<p>So, leaving one story behind and starting a new chapter in my life, I am studying Computer Engineering at Stip Goce Delcev University in Macedonia. While developing my skills in full-stack front-end development, I am also gaining knowledge in C++, Java, and Unreal Engine game design as a side project. I hope that years from now, I can fill in this introductory information as a working professional.</p>
